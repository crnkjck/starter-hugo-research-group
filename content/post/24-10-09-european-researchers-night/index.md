On September 27, 2024, the TERAIS team from UKBA DAI proudly took part in the European Researchers' Night, held in
Bratislava, Slovakia. This exciting annual event, designed to promote science and innovation, provided the perfect
platform for the TERAIS project team to showcase the cutting-edge research and technologies in the field of artificial
intelligence and robotics.

A highlight of our participation was humanoid robot NICO. Attendees were given hands-on experience with the robot,
learning about the advanced AI and robotics technology that powers its movements and AI language. The team explained the
intricate science behind NICO, offering a glimpse into how artificial intelligence can be integrated with robotics to
create machines that can mimic human behaviour and perform complex tasks.

As part of the event, Andrej Lučný, a key member of the TERAIS team, delivered a compelling presentation titled "Umelá
inteligencia pre riadenie humanoidného robota" (*Artificial Intelligence for Controlling a Humanoid Robot*) at V-Klub,
Bratislava. His talk delved into the fascinating world of AI-driven robotics, exploring how artificial intelligence can
be used to control and manage humanoid robots like NICO. Lučný discussed the challenges and breakthroughs in the
development of AI systems and deep learning that enable robots to interact with their environments in intelligent,
adaptable ways.

The European Researchers' Night provided a valuable opportunity for the TERAIS team to engage with the general public,
students, researchers, and tech enthusiasts. The TERAIS team encouraged questions and discussions, fostering curiosity
and excitement around the possibilities of AI and robotics. The TERAIS team’s participation in this event reflects the
ongoing commitment to advancing research in AI and robotics while sharing the knowledge and innovations with the wider
community.
