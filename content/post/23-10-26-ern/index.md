TERAIS project team in representation of the Department of Applied
Informatics of the Comenius University in Bratislava this year participated
at the [European Researchers’ Night in Bratislava](https://www.nocvyskumnikov.sk/european-researchers-night.html).
The [European Researchers’ Night](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/event/2023-european-researchers-night)
is a Europe-wide public celebration and showcase of the wide range of
scientists’ work, science and how it affects our daily lives in enjoyable,
fun and inspiring ways. This year TERAIS project brought in Bratislava an
unforgettable experience to all visitors and opportunity to immerse
themselves in the fascinating world of cognitive science, artificial
intelligence, applied informatics and their wide spectrum of research. The
centerpiece of UKBA DAI’s stand was the humanoid robot NICO. The visitors
got an opportunity to interact with him and see firsthand how scientific
knowledge is transformed into real-world applications.

Part of our rich program at the DAI stand was also an opportunity for
visitors to meet and speak with DAI’s senior researchers who provided
visitors’ valuable insights into the research conducted at our department
and information about our academic programmes.

As the TERAIS project team representing the Department of Applied
Informatics at Comenius University in Bratislava, we are truly delighted to
have participated in this year's European Researchers' Night. As we reflect
on this year's success, we eagerly look forward to what the next year will
bring. We are excited to continue our journey of discovery and inspiration
at the intersection of the science and society.
