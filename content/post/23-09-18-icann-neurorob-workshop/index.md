Neurorobotics brings together interdisciplinary research in machine learning, robotics and bio-inspired artificial intelligence. Embodying neural models in a physical agent allows interacting with and learning from a complex and multimodal environment. This makes robots an ideal platform for research on topics like multimodal and active sensing, complex object manipulation and navigation, neural reinforcement learning or verbal and non-verbal social interaction. For research in machine learning, robotic control provides a complex and challenging test environment where neural approaches can be evaluated and improved with regard to their ability to adapt, generalize and cope with noisy input. For neuro- and cognitive science research, neurorobotics provides an
environment to implement, evaluate and refine models of biological and human information processing.

In the session on Neurorobotics, we want to bring together researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing in the field of Neurorobotics. The topics include neural control and learning in robotics, sensor fusion, multimodal and active sensing in robots, bio-inspired and developmental robotics, human-robot interaction and collaboration.
