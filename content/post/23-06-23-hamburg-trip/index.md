TERAIS project team took part in another field trip this year. This time to
the vibrant city of Hamburg. This trip was a fantastic opportunity for the
project partners to come together, deepen the collaboration, and explore the
rich research which the University of Hamburg has to offer.

<!--more-->

One of the key components of the field trip was a hybrid-mode seminar on the
[Explainability and Robot Learning]({{< relref "../23-05-15-erl-seminar/" >}}).
This seminar brought together senior academics as well as younger
researchers in order to present and discuss various topics related to
machine learning methods, robotic learning, and computer vision.
The seminar grouped students, project and scientific staff of the three
partner universities in order to deepen their relationship and cooperation.

In addition to the seminar, the project team had the privilege of visiting
cutting-edge laboratories and work stations in the University of Hamburg.
The visit allowed partners and staff to first-hand witness the
ground-breaking research at the University and further built on the research
cooperation among the team members. Researchers from the University of
Hamburg really took upon themselves the introduction of their impressive
research and labs. The interactions with researchers and demonstrations of
their work sparked new ideas and fostered a deeper understanding of the
potential avenues for collaboration.

The field trip also served as a platform for project partners to hold
internal project meetings, sharing updates on progress of the project, and
project research. These project meetings have allowed us to discuss the
progress made so far, address challenges, and strategize for the future.
Personal face-to-face interactions strengthened our bonds and enabled
fruitful discussions and cooperations on the research level that propelled
TERAIS project forward. This trip positively endorsed exploration of
opportunities for joint research initiatives, collaborative publications,
and the exchange of resources and expertise.

Furthermore, the University of Hamburg team has also organised a series of
presentations about the structure of their master’s program, their research
and technology transfer as well as a presentation by the research management
team about management of grants at the university level. These presentations
have provided us with extensive knowledge about the establishment and system
at one of the largest universities in Germany.

As we reflect on our field trip to Hamburg, we are grateful for the
invaluable experiences and opportunities it provided. The city’s vibrant
atmosphere, thriving research ecosystem of the University of Hamburg,
innovative and explorative webinars, world-class lab visits, fruitful
project meetings and fostering of research collaborations have undoubtedly
enriched our project and brought us closer to achieving our goals. The
connections established during the field trip laid the foundation for
long-term partnerships that will continue to thrive beyond the scope of
TERIAS project. 

Stay tuned for updates on our ongoing research, collaborations, and the
exciting outcomes that emerge from TERAIS project. Together, we are shaping
the future of cognitive science research and AI research.
