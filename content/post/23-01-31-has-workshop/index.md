The development of artificial intelligent systems as interactive instruments
and collaborators of human well-being requires them to be designed on a
human scale. To this aim, human awareness can be considered the system’s
capability to interpret human behavior and be sensitive to their inner
states, such as beliefs, emotions, or intentions. At the intersection of
Cognitive Robotics, Machine Learning, and Human-Robot Interaction, this
approach suggests that the robot should maintain a model of humans to
understand, predict and anticipate their actions, needs and limitations.
Informed of this, artificial systems could understand information more or
less covertly expressed in human behavior. Also, this would allow robots to
communicate and cooperate in ways that are intuitive for the human partner.
From this perspective, human awareness is open to two other crucial
features: explainability and trustworthiness. Human users need to understand
how machines reach their decisions. This also concerns human-robot
interaction, where explainable robotic behavior supports trust and safety
from the human perspective. Mutual reliance and trustworthy interactions are
allowed by mutual knowledge of the parties. Only by developing artificial
systems with abilities to comprehend humans and to be comprehensible by
them, the quest for a human-centered technology will be achieved.

The workshop about this topic is promoted by the European twinning project
TERAIS (Towards Excellent Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at a Slovak
university), whose research aims to promote cognitive robotics and
human-robot interaction through the following three pillars: human
awareness, explainability, and trustworthiness.
