Carlo Mazzola is Research Fellow at the Italian Institute of Technology in the unit Cognitive Architectures for
Collaborative Technologies (CONTACT), where he works for the EU-funded project TERAIS (Towards Excellent Robotics and
Artificial Intelligence at a Slovak University). He graduated (MS) in Philosophy at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore
di Milano (Italy), after a period at the Bergische Universität Wuppertal (Germany), with a thesis about the role of
imagination and empathy in perception. After a period as Visiting Scientist at the Italian Institute of Technology in
the CONTACT unit, in which he explored mechanisms of social perception in HRI, in 2019 he started his Ph.D. in the same
institute in the unit Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences (RBCS), in which he investigated and developed mechanisms
of Shared Perception between humans and the humanoid robot iCub. In 2022 he has been Visiting Student at the Cognitive
Robotics Lab of the University of Manchester (Department of Computer Science).

Carlo Mazzola serves as the TERAIS project WP3 Achievement of Scientific Excellence Leader.
