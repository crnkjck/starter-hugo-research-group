Alexandra Dyalee is the Dissemination Assistant for the TERAIS Project. She is a successful artist both nationally and
internationally, having been awarded, among others, the curated prize MICHELANGELO, The Genius of Italy, and a
Certificate of Artistic Excellence from the Pinacothèque Museum in Luxembourg. She holds a Bachelor's Degree in Pure
Mathematics and is continuing on a research-oriented path in the MEi:CogSci Master's programme. In Cognitive Science,
she is pursuing research on the nature of Asperger's syndrome, which she also disseminates to the public in order to
avoid misinformation and stigma.

Her expertise in public relations management in relation to her own artistic career is a great strength for the public
facet of the project. This combines well with Alexandra's personal passion and experience of science and research, which
is at the heart of the project. Alexandra's strengths and skills include scientific writing, artistic writing,
communication with the public and a strong aesthetic sense.

Alexandra's current role is that of Dissemination Assistant, which involves preparing posts for social media, as well as
ad hoc visual edits alongside other dissemination project activities.
