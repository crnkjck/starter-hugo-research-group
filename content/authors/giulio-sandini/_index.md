graduating in Electronic Engineering (Bioengineering) at the University of
Genova he was research fellow and assistant professor at the Scuola Normale
Superiore in Pisa until 1984. During this period, working at the Laboratorio
di Neurofisiologia of the CNR, he investigated aspects of visual processing
at the level of single neurons as well as aspects of visual perception in
human adults and children. He has been Visiting Research Associate at the
Department of Neurology of the Harvard Medical School in Boston where he
developed diagnostic techniques based on brain electrical activity mapping.
After his return to Genova in 1984 as associate professor, in 1990 he
founded the LIRA-Lab (Laboratory for Integrated Advanced Robotics,
www.liralab.it). In 1996 he was Visiting Scientist at the Artificial
