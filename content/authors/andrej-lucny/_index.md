Andrej Lúčny received his Ph.D. in applied informatics from Comenius University in Bratislava, where he works as an
assistant professor at the Department of Applied Informatics. His research integrates methods of artificial intelligence
and computer vision into real-time systems. He has developed a blackboard-based architecture for mobile robot control
and applied it to studying the self-recognition of robots at the mirror and the imitation game. He is a former system
development manager and management member in a worldwide operating SME. He designed several products for the monitoring
market, including airport weather systems, nuclear power plant warning systems, and tire production quality checks. For
several years he worked for EC as an evaluator of FP7/H2020 projects (Factories of Future). He is a co-founder of civil
society Robotika.sk which deals with the popularization of robotics in Slovakia.
