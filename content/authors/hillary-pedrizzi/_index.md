Hillary Pedrizzi is a masterâ€™s student in Middle European Interdisciplinary Cognitive Science program at Comenius
University in Bratislava, at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics, and Informatics from 2021. She received an Erasmus
mobility scholarship to study at the University of Vienna. There, she contributed to a research project in Comparative
Cognition, at the Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology.

Her research interests lie in computational modeling of cognitive mechanism and in understanding cognitive dynamics
underlying the interaction between human and non-human intelligent agents. The last interest led her to join the Italian
Institute of Technology in Genova in the CONTACT unit, as part of TERAIS project in 2023. As a visiting researcher, she
contributed to the Social Drawing Project focusing on investigating the social cognitive aspects related to Human-Robot
Interaction.
