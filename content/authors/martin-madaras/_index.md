Martin finished his Ph.D. at the end of 2014 in the field of computer graphics in informatics at Comenius University,
Bratislava. At the beginning of 2015, he started as a part-time research assistant at the university and a freelance
researcher and developer. In 2016 Martin was at TU Wien as a SAIA post-doc researcher and in 2017 he co-founded the
company Skeletex Research, where he currently works as CEO and research lead. Between 2018 and 2021 he worked as a
part-time assistant professor at Slovak Technical University. In 2023 he started a part-time associate professor
position at Comenius University. Currently, his focus is given to hybrid methodology in 3D computer vision, where
data-driven methods are trained on synthetically rendered training data and merged with analytical methods for superior
performance on real-world data captured by 3D cameras.
