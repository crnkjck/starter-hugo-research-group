Joshua Zonca is a postdoctoral researcher at the Psychology Department of the University of Milano-Bicocca and visiting
researcher at the CONTACT (COgNiTive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) Unit of the Italian Institute of
Technology (IIT). He received his Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from CIMEC - Centre for Mind/Brain sciences at the
University of Trento. His research focuses on the cognitive and social normative mechanisms modulating human interaction
with peers, robots and machines. Currently, he is particularly interested in the factors leading to a suboptimal use of
valuable information for upcoming behavior and in how interaction with robots and artificial intelligence can improve
human decision making in social scenarios.
