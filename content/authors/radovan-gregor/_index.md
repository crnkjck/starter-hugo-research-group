Radovan Gregor received his masterâ€™s degree in robotics and cybernetics at the Slovak Technical University in
Bratislava. Since 2019, he has been conducting professional trainings in the field of programming and application of
robotic systems. Since 2023, he has been studying at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, Comenius
University in Bratislava, as an external doctoral student.

Among his research interests is the understanding of artificial neural network models and their use for cognitive
modelling in robotics. His research focuses on the design and implementation of a suitable neural model and its testing
on the humanoid robot NICO. The aim of the work is to propose the principles of trustworthy interaction between humanoid
robots and people.
