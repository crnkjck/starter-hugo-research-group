Laxmi is a postdoctoral researcher, who has previously done research in the USA and Singapore, where she has done her
doctoral studies. She has worked on Computational Cognitive Modelling and Neuromorphic Engineering.

In Computational Modelling, she has specifically worked on modelling idea generation, category learning, perception of
moving objects and the prediction of their trajectories. Recently she has been interested in and worked on cognitive
semantics.

In Neuromorphic Engineering, she has explored STDP learning on models with leaky integrate and fire neurons. She has
studied the characteristics of neuromorphic datasets such as N-MNIST and DVS-Gestures.

In TERAIS, Laxmi is interested in examining cognitive theories on embodied robots, and providing bio-inspired solutions
to issues in robotics.
