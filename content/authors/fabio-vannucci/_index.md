for Collaborative Technologies (CONTACT). He graduated (MS) in Computer Science Engineering at Universit√† degli Studi di
Genova (Italy). In 2016 he started his Ph.D. at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in the unit Robotics, Brain and
Cognitive Sciences (RBCS), in which he investigated the role of motion in Human-Robot interaction and developed new
styles of human-like movements for the robot iCub. In 2017 he has been Visiting Student at the National Institute of
Communications and Information Technology (NICT) in Osaka, Japan, where he studied the differences in the perception of
robot motion between Italy and Japan.
