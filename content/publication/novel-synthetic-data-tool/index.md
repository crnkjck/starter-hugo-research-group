abstract: |
  Application of neural networks in industrial settings, such as automated factories with bin-picking solutions requires
  costly production of large labeled datasets. This paper presents an automatic data generation tool with a procedural
  model of a cardboard box. We briefly demonstrate the capabilities of the system, and its various parameters and
  empirically prove the usefulness of the generated synthetic data by training a simple neural network. We make sample
  synthetic data generated by the tool publicly available.
