abstract: |
  Addressee Estimation is the ability to understand to whom a person is talking, a skill essential for social robots to
  interact smoothly with humans. In this sense, it is one of the problems that must be tackled to develop effective
  conversational agents in multi-party and unstructured scenarios. As humans, one of the channels that mainly lead us to
  such estimation is the non-verbal behavior of speakers: first of all, their gaze and body pose. Inspired by human
  perceptual skills, in the present work, a deep-learning model for Addressee Estimation relying on these two non-verbal
  features is designed, trained, and deployed on an iCub robot. The study presents the procedure of such implementation
  and the performance of the model deployed in real-time human-robot interaction compared to previous tests on the
  dataset used for the training.
