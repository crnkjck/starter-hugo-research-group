abstract: |
  The main stream of educational robotics platforms orbits the various versions of versatile robotics sets and kits,
  while interesting outliers add new opportunities and extend the possible learning situations. Examples of such are
  reconfigurable robots, rolling sphere robots, humanoids, swimming or underwater robots. Another kind within this
  category are flying drones. While remotely-controlled drones were a very attractive target for hobby model makers for
  quite a long time already, they were seldom used in educational scenarios as robots that are programmed by children
  and perform various simple tasks. A milestone was reached with the introduction of the educational drone Tello, which
  can be programmed even in Scratch, or some general purpose languages such as Node.js or Python. The programs do not
  have a direct access to the robot sensors - nevertheless they are still used by the underlying layers of the
  controller. However, they have the option to acquire the image from the drone camera and perform actions based on
  processing of the camera image frames with computer vision algorithms. We have been using this drone in an educational
  robotics competition for three years without camera, and after our students have developed several successful projects
  that utilized a camera, we prepared a new competition challenge that require the use of the camera. In the short
  article, we summarize our experiences with educational drones, and their use in the student projects and competition.
