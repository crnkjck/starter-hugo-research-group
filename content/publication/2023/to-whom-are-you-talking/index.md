abstract: |
  Communicating shapes our social word. For a robot to be considered social and being consequently integrated in our
  social environment it is fundamental to understand some of the dynamics that rule human-human communication. In this
  work, we tackle the problem of Addressee Estimation, the ability to understand an utterance's addressee, by
  interpreting and exploiting non-verbal bodily cues from the speaker. We do so by implementing an hybrid deep learning
  model composed of convolutional layers and LSTM cells taking as input images portraying the face of the speaker and 2D
  vectors of the speaker's body posture. Our implementation choices were guided by the aim to develop a model that could
  be deployed on social robots and be efficient in ecological scenarios. We demonstrate that our model is able to solve
  the Addressee Estimation problem in terms of addressee localisation in space, from a robot ego-centric point of view.
