abstract="Minimal Hitting Set (MHS) is a well-known and complete method to compute all minimal explanations of an ABox abduction problem in Description Logics (DL). MHS is NP-complete and generally recognized as inefficient. We leverage on MergeXplain (MXP) which is fast but incomplete -- by combining it with MHS in a hybrid algorithm MHS-MXP to regain completeness. In this paper, we describe: (a) the underlying theory to establish the completeness of MHS-MXP and show its relevant properties; (b) a class of inputs on which MHS-MXP has the greatest advantage; (c) an experimental implementation; (d) an empirical evaluation on both favourable and unfavourable inputs.",
