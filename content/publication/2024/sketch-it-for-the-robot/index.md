abstract: |
  The work proposes investigating drawing activities in interactive contexts to shed light on the links between
  socio-cognitive and visual representation mechanisms. In our study, 53 adult participants were instructed to draw some
  object categories (e.g., a duck, an ambulance, …) for a child-like robot, which first was just shown in a picture (
  individual condition) and then was co-present and engaged in joint attention behaviors with them (robot condition). The
  data collection was carried out in two sites, in Italy ( N=26 ) and Slovakia ( N=27 ), with two different robots, iCub
  and Nico. Participants significantly changed their drawing strategy in the presence of the robots by enlarging their
  sketches while speeding up their drawing. The phenomenon was more evident the more the individuals perceived the robot
  as closer to them, according to the IOS scale. The results were highly consistent between the two sites and showed that
  participants put more effort into drawing understandably when a robot actively attends to their behavior. Higher clarity
  is obtained with increased figure size rather than simplifying the drawing. Counter-intuitively, participants did not
  slow down their tracing to be more comprehensible. Instead, they became faster in front of the robot, potentially
  induced by the pressure of being observed by it. These findings are discussed in the framework of the motionese
  literature.
