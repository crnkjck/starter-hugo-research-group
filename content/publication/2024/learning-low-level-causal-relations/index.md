abstract: |
  Causal learning allows humans to predict the effect of their actions on the known environment and use this knowledge
  to plan the execution of more complex actions. Such knowledge also captures the behaviour of the environment and can
  be used for its analysis and the reasoning behind the behaviour. This type of knowledge is also crucial in the design
  of intelligent robotic systems with common sense. In this paper, we study causal relations by learning the forward and
  inverse models based on data generated by a simulated robotic arm involved in two sensorimotor tasks. As a next step,
  we investigate feature attribution methods for the analysis of the forward model, which reveals the low-level causal
  effects corresponding to individual features of the state vector related to both the arm joints and the environment
  features. This type of analysis provides solid ground for dimensionality reduction of the state representations, as
  well as for the aggregation of knowledge towards the explainability of causal effects at higher levels.
