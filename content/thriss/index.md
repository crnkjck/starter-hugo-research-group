## About THRISS

Social interaction is not always an easy task. Others' behavior might be ambiguous and hard to grasp. As a result,
sometimes it is difficult to establish a common ground, the minimum grade of reciprocal understanding required for
interactions to be meaningful, and this is particularly true for social interactions between humans and robots, the
study of which is generally termed the Human-Robot Interaction or HRI. While humans develop their socio-cognitive
abilities for improving mutual understanding quite early in their lives, robots lack such skills. Utilizing cognitive
modeling within cognitive robotics is a way to make robots more considerate and aware of people as well as make their
behavior more legible and explainable and make robots more socially appealing and available. Not just the appearance,
but behavior and interaction of robots with humans should lead people to trust them, rendering this trust as justified.
At the intersection of Social Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, and Cognitive Robotics, research calls for a
multidisciplinary effort. The Summer School on Cognitive Robotics for Social Interaction promotes this multifaceted
approach.

## Invited Speakers and Lecturers

<ul class="list-unstyled">

### Lectures

## Pablo Barros (Sony Corporation, Brussels, Belgium)

<li><b>Bio:</b> Pablo Barros is currently a senior research Scientist at Sony Europe, in Belgium. Since he concluded his PhD at the University of Hamburg, He has worked on affective computing and social robotics over the past years, in particular on the modeling of intrinsic affect on dynamic and contextually rich interactions. His current research interests include the modeling of competitive and cooperative behavior in human dynamics, the exploration of explainable AI for affective perception, and the continual adaptation of social agents towards multiple persons.
</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Towards Modeling Social Components of Trust in Competitive and Cooperative Game-Based Interactions</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> Contextual games like complex card games and role-playing games (RPGs) offer rich, narrative-driven environments that are ideal for studying and modeling social constructs such as empathy, rivalry, trust, engagement, and competitiveness. These games require players to navigate complex emotional landscapes, make strategic decisions based on social cues, and engage in deep narrative experiences, all within a structured but highly flexible environment. By adding intelligent agents and robots into these scenarios, researchers can investigate how these systems can understand and replicate human social behaviors, adapt to emotional contexts, and contribute to shared experiences in meaningful ways. In this talk, I will present some of the research I have been doing in this area, in particular on the modeling of such social cues, and their implication on the development of high-level social constructs, such as trust.</li>

## Shelly Levy Tzedek (Ben Gurion University, Beersheba, Israel)

<li><b>Bio:</b> Shelly Levy-Tzedek is an associate professor and heads the Cognition, Aging and Rehabilitation laboratory at Ben-Gurion University.

In 2023 she was a Scholar-in-Residence at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Trusting Social Robots in Rehabilitation: Participatory design and ethical considerations</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> I will review studies in my lab, in which we collected, as part of the design process, qualitative data from the main stakeholders - including patients, family members and clinicians. I will argue that this helps minimize errors in the design process. I will then discuss how trust in the context of rehabilitation is different from other human-robot interaction context. I will end with the 10 questions I drafted with colleagues, which each robotic development team should be asked, so we can evaluate the benefit of their contribution to society. </li>

## Matthias Kerzel (University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany)

</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Developing Research Platforms for Neuro-Cognitive Robotics</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> As AI researchers, why do we spend so much effort on robotic platforms? Do we really need one more dataset? No! However, we need an artificial agent that can autonomously collect its own data, make decisions to gather information and learn through interaction with a complex physical world. We need embodied agents to study HRI and hard-to-simulate tasks like haptic perception. To this end, we developed NICO and NICOL, the Neuro-Inspired Companion and the Neuro-Inspired Collaborator. In this talk, we present selected studies, conducted on these platforms, ranging from developmental robotics to HRI and XAI.</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> A developmental perspective on cognitive robotics for interaction</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> This lecture will focus on cognitive robotics, discussing how to empower robots to establish more intelligent interactions with humans. The aim is to create robots that understand our needs, desires, and intentions while being transparent in their behavior. We discuss how cognitive robots can improve HRI through predictive capabilities, informed decision-making, and autonomous adaptation. Drawing inspiration from the natural progression of human cognitive skills since childhood, we propose a developmental approach for designing more human-centric machines better suited at interacting with us.</li>

</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Sensorized devices for Human-aware human-robot Interaction</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> The development of robots’ abilities to engage in interactions with humans entails addressing a double direction: from the reception and processing of information coming from the human-populated environment to the design of robots’ behaviors to act towards it. This workshop will bring students hands-on experience on how to leverage different sensors (and hence multiple modalities) to develop skills to make robots interact with humans and the shared environment. Beyond cameras and microphones, a haptic device (the iCube) will be exploited to interact with the iCub robot simulator using the YARP middleware, Gazebo. With a modular approach, LLM-language reasoner and deep-learning computer vision and speech processing models will be complementary abilities to use and connect.</li>
