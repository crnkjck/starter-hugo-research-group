The international project
**Towards Excellent Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at a Slovak university** (TERAIS),
funded by the **Horizon Europe** programme under the Twinning call started at
the beginning of October 2022.
The lead partner of the project is
the Department of Applied Informatics (DAI)
of **Comenius University in Bratislava**, Slovakia (UKBA),
which is to become a workplace of international academic excellence.
Its scientists will collaborate with distinguished academic partners
from the **University of Hamburg** in Germany
and the **Italian Institute of Technology** in Genoa.

The project has four key pillars, namely
* the **development of people**,
* **international networking**,
* **research excellence**, and
* **research support**.


## Objectives

“The **joint research** will focus on cognitive robotics
using artificial neural networks and deep learning,
which are currently cutting-edge technologies
in the field of artificial intelligence.
This research will contribute to the development of robots
that are trustworthy for humans to interact with on a daily basis.
We believe that the collaborative research and sharing of knowledge
within the partnership will take the research and innovation
in our workplace to an international level.
The project will raise the **awareness of the general public** about
robot-related technologies as a key component of a modern IT-based society
and **increase the reputation, profile and attractiveness**
of Slovak research institutions,”
said Professor Igor Farkaš, the head of DAI and the project coordinator.

The project will also examine the current conditions and needs of scientists
at the Department of Applied Informatics at the Faculty of Mathematics,
Physics and Informatics of Comenius University. Based on the analysis, a
plan will be developed to make the **human capital development** more systematic
and lifelong. International staff and student exchanges will play an
indispensable role in this process. Specific activities will focus on
building the necessary **research support structures** for successful project
proposals. Researchers of UKBA will be given the opportunity to draw
inspiration from the long-term experience of the international partners
during exchange visits.

International cooperation will contribute to **networking** and the
establishment of long-term and **sustainable international research
partnerships**. Links will also be established with other key players in the
local innovation ecosystem, such as IT companies and technology start-ups.
Dissemination and communication will be fostered through staff and student
exchanges as well as the organization of joint events such as webinars and
workshops. The submission of joint funding proposals and the joint
preparation of research publications are also planned. Modern means of
**dissemination and communication** will be used to inform about the outcomes of
the project and the joint research activities.
