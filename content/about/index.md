**TERAIS** (The Towards Excellent Robotics and Artificial Intelligence)
is an international effort aimed at establishing
the Department of Applied Informatics (DAI)
of **Comenius University in Bratislava**, Slovakia (UKBA)
as a workplace of international academic excellence.
Funded by the **Horizon Europe** programme under the Twinning call,
the project brings together experts
from the **University of Hamburg** in Germany
and the **Italian Institute of Technology** in Genoa
to collaborate with scientists at UKBA.

The project has four key pillars,
the development of people,
international networking,
research excellence,
and research support.
With a focus on cognitive robotics and artificial neural networks,
the joint research efforts aim to contribute
to the development of trustworthy and human-friendly robots.
The project will also focus on enhancing the human capital development
and research support structures at UKBA
and building long-term international research partnerships.


## Research excellence

TERAIS project aims to take the research and innovation at UKBA
to an international level by sharing knowledge and best practices
with distinguished academic partners.
The goal of the project is also to raise awareness
about the role of robotics and AI in a modern IT-based society
and increase the reputation and profile of Slovak research institutions.


## International networking

International cooperation is at the heart of TERAIS,
with a focus on establishing long-term and sustainable
international research partnerships.
The project will also connect UKBA with other key players
in the local innovation ecosystem,
such as IT companies and technology start-ups.
Dissemination and communication will be fostered
through staff and student exchanges,
joint events, and joint funding proposals.


## Human capital development & Research support

The TERAIS project will examine
the current conditions and needs of scientists at UKBA
and develop a plan to make human capital development
more systematic and lifelong.
International staff and student exchanges
will play an indispensable role in this process.

<p class="mt-4">
In conclusion,
TERAIS is a highly ambitious project
aimed at establishing UKBA as a hub of excellence
in the field of robotics and AI.
Through collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and international networking,
the project will help advance the field
and contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies
that can have a positive impact on society.
